# Autonomous Robot Navigation using Reinforcement Learning

This project implements an autonomous navigation system for a scout-type robot in an unstructured environment using Reinforcement Learning (DQN).
The goal is to enable the robot to learn optimal navigation strategies through interaction with the environment, without predefined rules.
